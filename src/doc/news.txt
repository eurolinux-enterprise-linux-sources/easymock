News in EasyMock 1.2 (since 1.1):

- EasyMock is released in two versions: 
  One for Java 1.3 and above, and one for Java 1.5

Changes in both versions: 
- order of arguments for ArgumentsMatcher is like in EasyMock 1.0 now
- stack traces are now only cut if the exception is thrown from EasyMock
- convenience methods expectAndDefaultReturn() and expectAndDefaultThrow()
  allow setting default return values and throwables in one line of code
- hashCode() implementation is changed for better performance
- added Clover coverage reports

New features in the Java 1.5 version:
- support for VarArgs
- type safety: expectAndReturn() and expectAndDefaultReturn() for Objects
  now check whether the given return value is applicable. Trying
  control.expectAndReturn(mock.getString(), new Object())
  will now generate an error at compile time instead of runtime.  
- MockControl uses generics now, the mock object needs not to be casted
  anymore
