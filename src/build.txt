Compiling EasyMock in Eclipse 3.0 and above should work right away.

To build EasyMock with Ant,
- copy junit.jar of JUnit 3.8.1 to ./lib/junit.jar
- copy clover.jar of Clover 1.3.8 to ./lib/clover.jar
- copy your clover license file to ./lib/clover.license
- add ./lib/junit.jar and .lib/clover.jar to your Ant home
- if you do not work with Mac OS X 10.4,
  copy easymockbuild.properties to your home directory
  and change the properties in the copy according to your environment
- run ant ;-)

Troubleshooting
- if the javadoc task fails, add the path to the javadoc executable to your PATH variable
- if the javac task fails, add tools.jar to your Ant home
